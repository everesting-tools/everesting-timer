# "Everesting Stopwatch" User Guide

This application is designed to help you track your progress during long endurance challenges like Everesting.

## 1. Getting Started

Before starting your challenge, it is recommended to visit the **"Settings"** panel (button in the top navigation bar).

### In Settings, you can configure:
- **Name and Track:** This data will be used in the future for generating reports.
- **Goal (laps):** Specify the total number of laps you plan to complete. This value is used to calculate your overall progress.
- **Distance and Ascent per Lap:** Enter the distance (in km) and elevation gain (in m) you achieve in a single lap.
- **Theme and Language:** Choose your preferred color scheme and interface language.

## 2. Challenge Controls

All main controls are located directly on the timer displays.

### Main Timer (Top, largest display)
- **"Start" Button:** Tap the main timer area to begin the challenge. The timers will start running.
- **"Finish" Button:** After starting, the "Start" button becomes "Finish". Tap it to end the challenge. This action will automatically log the final lap.

### Lap Timer (Middle display)
- **"Lap" Button:** After starting, a button appears on this timer. Tap it at the end of each completed lap to record it.
- **Color Indication:** The text of this timer changes color based on your pace relative to your average time, in sync with the progress bar below it.

### Pause Timer (Bottom, appears when needed)
- **"Pause" Button:** After starting, a button appears where the pause timer will be. Tap it to pause the "moving time" calculation.

- **"Resume" Button:** Tap the same area again to resume. The Pause Timer will disappear.

## 3. Analyzing Your Progress

### Progress Bars
- **Top Bar (Overall Progress):** Shows what percentage of your lap goal you have completed.
- **Bottom Bar (Lap Progress):** Shows your current pace. It fills up in real-time, comparing your current lap time to the average time of all previous laps. If you are faster than average, it will fill up slower.

### Color Indication for Bars and Lap Timer
- **< 85%:** Blue (normal pace)
- **85-90%:** Green (good pace)
- **90-95%:** Yellow (caution, close to average)
- **95-100%:** Orange (you are slower than average)
- **> 100%:** Red (you are significantly behind the average pace)

### "Table" Panel
Open this panel to see detailed information for each lap:
- **Lap №**
- **Total Time:** The "clean" moving time at the moment the lap was completed.
- **Lap Time:** The "clean" time it took to complete that specific lap.
- **+/-:** The deviation of this lap's time from the previous average (green for faster, red for slower).
- **Pause Time:** The total duration of all pauses taken during that lap.

## 4. Finishing and Resetting

- **"Finish" Button:** Ends the challenge. Afterward, all control buttons are locked.
